## 📌 Project Description

This system is designed to simulate the control of 3 elevators in a building. It **does not implement a full queueing system**, but instead uses a simple scoring logic to assign the most suitable elevator based on its current position and workload.

The system is ideal for demonstrating UART communication, command parsing, and basic GPIO-based LED control in embedded development.

### Actual behavior based on current code:
- Chooses the nearest elevator to the `from` floor using a simple `distance + workload` score
- Accepts commands in the form `UP,from,to` or `DOWN,from,to` via USB CDC
- Elevator moves to `from` floor, then continues to `to`
- No task queue or multiple-user support
- Displays elevator position via LEDs on GPIO pins

## 🧠 Features

- Controls 3 elevators in real-time using STM32
- Communicates with Simulation Board (SB) via UART
- Receives commands over USB CDC, e.g.:
  - `UP,2,5\r\n` → Elevator goes to floor 2, then floor 5
  - `GETCurrFloor,1\r\n` → Queries current floor of elevator 1
- GPIO LEDs indicate elevator position (on ports PA, PB)
- Uses a 100ms timer interrupt to simulate elevator movement logic

## 🔧 Comparison with Full Requirement

| Feature | This System | Expected by Instructor |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Multi-request Queue | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Required (per-car or global queue) |
| Pickup and drop flow | ✔️ from → to | ✅ Should support multiple sequential requests |
| Multi-user request handling | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Required |
| Priority-based queueing | ❌ Simple distance/workload only | ✅ Should evaluate based on time or fairness |
| Communication | ✔️ USB CDC + UART | ✔️ Correct |
